# About ChildMediCalc mobile application

This app was created to help parents who want to have scientific dose estimation before giving medicine to their children. This application allows users to have up-to-date information regarding the wait time at the emergency room of CHEO's main campus located at 401 Smyth Road, Ottawa. Also, it contains a calculator that allows a better estimation of the dose of medicine (currently limited to Tylenol and Advil) derived based on the age and weight of the child using the information provided in [CHEO fact sheet](https://www.cheo.on.ca/en/resources-and-support/p5325.aspx#). The application supports both Canada's official languages (English, and French).

# Inspiratioin

I am a happy parent of a kid who is pretty normal besides the fact that she is on a smaller scale by weight compared to other kids of her age. So every time we need to give her medicine we have to calculate the correct dose based on the weight of the child. It is not a complicated calculation but when your child cries beside you, you are already under stress and if it can be reduced by just simplifying the process it would be a huge help, in my personal opinion.

# Future Plans

[ ] Add more types of medicine to the database
[ ] Add a map of the CHEO Main Campus
